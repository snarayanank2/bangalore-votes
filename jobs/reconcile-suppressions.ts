/**
 * Daily reconciliation of `suppressions` against SendGrid's own
 * suppression lists (Task 55; architecture §7: "a periodic reconciliation
 * of `suppressions` against SendGrid's own suppression list — the safety
 * net if a webhook event is ever lost", Task 53's bounce/complaint
 * webhooks being the primary path).
 *
 * ENV-GATED, same graceful-skip posture as src/lib/send/sendgrid.ts: no
 * `SENDGRID_API_KEY` means this logs one line and exits 0 — nothing is
 * fetched, nothing throws.
 *
 * SENDGRID v3 SUPPRESSION ENDPOINTS (ASSUMED SHAPE — this job has never
 * run against a live SendGrid account; implemented against SendGrid's
 * documented v3 API. If the real shape differs, the env-gate means this
 * no-ops safely everywhere else until it's actually configured and can be
 * checked against a real account):
 *   - GET /v3/suppression/bounces         -> [{ email, reason, ... }]
 *   - GET /v3/suppression/spam_reports    -> [{ email, ... }]
 *   - GET /v3/asm/suppressions/global     -> [{ email, ... }]
 * Each is fetched ONE PAGE (`?limit=1000`) per run — SendGrid suppression
 * lists are typically small and this job runs daily, so a day's worth of
 * new suppressions comfortably fits one page; full pagination is left for
 * if that assumption ever breaks (would show up as this job's counts
 * staying flat while SendGrid's own dashboard count keeps climbing).
 *
 * `addSuppression` (src/lib/suppressions.ts) is idempotent on
 * `(contact, channel)`, so this just calls it for every row SendGrid
 * returns — no need to diff against what's already stored.
 *
 * NO PII IN LOGS: the summary below carries only counts per list, never
 * an email address (architecture §13).
 *
 * RESILIENT, NOT FRAGILE: a fetch failure (network error, non-2xx) is
 * caught, logged, and this job exits 1 — it never throws uncaught, so a
 * wedged SendGrid API never crashes the jobs container's cron process,
 * it just fails this one run (and cron/monitoring notices the nonzero
 * exit).
