/**
 * Structured logging (pino) + server-side-only, env-gated Sentry error
 * reporting.
 *
 * Architecture references: §10 "Structured logs to stdout via Compose
 * logging" and "Sentry (free tier), server-side only — `app` and `jobs`
 * report errors; there is no client-side Sentry, so no added JS and no CSP
 * change; event content is scrubbed per §13"; §13 "Logs & telemetry carry
 * IDs, not identities ... Sentry runs with default PII capture off and
 * server-side scrubbing of contact and address fields".
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * PII SCRUB — THE LOAD-BEARING PART OF THIS FILE
 * ============================================================================
 * `scrubPii` is a pure, recursive redactor: it walks any plain object/array
 * and replaces the VALUE of any key matching (case-insensitively) the PII
 * key set below with `'[redacted]'`. It is wired into BOTH pino (every log
 * line's merging object is scrubbed by `formatters.log` before
 * serialization — this covers arbitrary nesting/keys, which a static
 * `redact` path list cannot) and Sentry's `beforeSend` (the entire event —
 * `request`, `extra`, `contexts`, breadcrumbs, `message` — is scrubbed
 * before it ever leaves the box). String VALUES are additionally passed
 * through a best-effort email/phone regex scrub as defense-in-depth, since
 * an opaque-looking field could still carry PII in free text (e.g. an
 * error message that happens to interpolate an address) — the key-based
 * redaction above is the primary control and what tests must exercise.
 *
 * Cycles and pathological nesting are guarded: a `seen` set tracks the
 * object chain currently being walked (only true cycles up the ancestor
 * chain trip it, not two sibling fields that happen to share a reference),
 * and a hard depth cap stops runaway recursion on deeply-nested-but-acyclic
 * input.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * SENTRY ENV-GATING: `Sentry.init` is called at most once, only when
 * `SENTRY_DSN` is set. Unset (dev/test/CI) -> this module is a clean no-op:
 * no network call, no throw, `captureException` just logs via pino.
 * `@sentry/node` only — never `@sentry/browser`, never imported from
 * client-shipped code, so no added JS and no CSP change (architecture
 * §13/§14.5).
