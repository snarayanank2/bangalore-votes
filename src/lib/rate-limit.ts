/**
 * Per-account contribution rate limiting (PRD §6.3 — registration-gating
 * gives every flag/vote an identity, enabling dedup + rate-limit; PRD §12
 * "rate-limiting on all contribution actions"; architecture §3 — no Redis,
 * Postgres-backed).
 *
 * Design: there is no separate counter table. Each limited action already
 * writes a row carrying `userId`/`createdBy` + `createdAt` (flag_submissions,
 * issue_vote_sets, media), so the limit is enforced by COUNTing the user's
 * own rows created within a trailing time window ("sliding window" — not a
 * fixed calendar-day bucket). This mirrors the shape of `consumeBudget` in
 * `src/lib/budgets.ts` but counts existing rows rather than maintaining an
 * upserted counter, because the underlying writes are the thing being
 * limited (there's nothing else to increment).
 *
 * `eoi` (expression-of-interest submissions) is anonymous — `eoi_submissions`
 * has no `userId` column — so it cannot be checked per-account. It's kept in
 * the `RateLimitAction` union for type completeness / call-site symmetry;
 * calling `checkAccountLimit` with it throws. Real EOI abuse protection is
 * reCAPTCHA (Task 50), not this module.
 *
 * Callers (Tasks 31 flags, 33 votes, 35 media upload) call
 * `checkDefaultLimit` before performing their write and return a 429-ish
 * response when it resolves to `false`.
