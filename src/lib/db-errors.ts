/**
 * Shared driver-error classification helpers.
 *
 * drizzle-orm (0.45+) wraps every driver error thrown from a query in a
 * `DrizzleQueryError`, which does NOT copy the underlying driver error's
 * `.code` onto itself — the original `postgres` package error (with its
 * `.code`) is only reachable via `.cause`. Any catch site that needs to
 * distinguish a specific Postgres error code must therefore check both
 * shapes, or it will silently miss the wrapped case (Task 29 review: this
 * exact gap left src/lib/auth-flow.ts's registration race undetected).
