/**
 * The campaign send path: given a user and a send code (W1..F1 —
 * architecture.md §7/§10, docs/prd.md §9.3), resolves which channels are
 * eligible, honours suppressions BEFORE every send, renders the message,
 * dispatches it (or logs a no-op under `SENDS_DISABLED`), and writes exactly
 * one `campaign_sends` row per (code, userId, channel) — the send-once
 * ledger enforced by `send_once_uq`.
 *
 * ORDERING PER CHANNEL (mirrors src/lib/otp.ts's cooldown ordering style —
 * cheapest/safest checks first):
 *   1. Channel eligibility — contact present AND the user's toggle is on
 *      (`emailEnabled`/`whatsappEnabled`, /account/notifications). A
 *      channel that fails this check is simply not attempted; it never
 *      appears in the returned `results` and no ledger row is written for
 *      it (there is nothing to record — the user opted the channel out
 *      entirely, distinct from "suppressed").
 *   2. Send-once — if a `campaign_sends` row already exists for
 *      (code, userId, channel), this is a re-run (e.g. a retried job): skip
 *      the send AND the insert, returning the existing row's status. This
 *      check exists so a re-run never even attempts the insert that
 *      `send_once_uq` would reject — the unique index is the backstop, not
 *      the primary mechanism.
 *   3. Suppression (architecture §7: "honoured before every send") — a
 *      bounce/complaint/STOP on this exact contact+channel. Recorded as its
 *      own ledger status (`'suppressed'`) rather than silently skipped, so
 *      the audit trail shows WHY a user didn't get a message they were
 *      otherwise eligible for.
 *   4. Render + send.
 *
 * SENDS_DISABLED (architecture.md §14.2, the staging guard): when
 * `process.env.SENDS_DISABLED === 'true'`, no transport is called at all —
 * this function logs the code/userId/channel and writes the ledger row as
 * `'sent'` anyway. This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight: the
 * send-once ledger's whole job is "never send the same code to the same
 * user twice", and that guarantee has to hold in staging too (where jobs
 * run on the same cron schedule against real, non-disposable ward data) —
 * a distinct "disabled" status would make every staging run resend forever
 * once SENDS_DISABLED flips off. The disabled-ness is legible from the log
 * line, not from the ledger.
 *
 * PRIVACY (architecture.md §13): logged fields are code/userId/channel/
 * status ONLY — never the resolved contact (email/phone).
