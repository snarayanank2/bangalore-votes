/**
 * The deduped flag queue (PRD §6.1-§6.3; architecture §7) — the citizen
 * misinformation-flagging path and the curator correction loop's front
 * door.
 *
 * DEDUPE (PRD §6.3): "multiple flags on the same field collapse into ONE
 * queue item with a count; resolving resolves every collapsed flag at
 * once, same outcome + reason". The schema encodes this as a PARTIAL
 * unique index, `flag_dedupe_uq` on `target_ref` WHERE `status = 'pending'`
 * — at most one PENDING `flag_items` row per `target_ref` at any time, but
 * any number of already-resolved (accepted/rejected) rows for that same
 * `target_ref` are allowed to coexist (a full composite index on
 * `(target_ref, status)` would wrongly also forbid two rows sharing the
 * SAME non-pending status, e.g. a second reject after flag→reject→flag→
 * reject on the same target). Every citizen submission for the same
 * `targetRef` finds-or-creates that one pending item and appends its own
 * `flag_submissions` row; the item's submission count IS the "count" the
 * queue UI shows. A fresh flag on a target whose prior item was already
 * resolved (accepted or rejected) opens a brand-new pending item — the
 * resolved item(s) and the new pending one coexist; resolution history is
 * never overwritten.
 *
 * RACE (two submitters flagging the same never-before-flagged target at
 * the same instant): both find no pending row and both attempt to INSERT
 * one; the unique index lets exactly one succeed, and the loser gets a
 * 23505. A failed statement aborts the enclosing Postgres transaction for
 * every subsequent statement UNTIL a ROLLBACK (or a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT)
 * — so the insert attempt below runs inside a NESTED transaction
 * (`tx.transaction(...)`, which drizzle-orm's postgres-js driver
 * implements as a SAVEPOINT, see node_modules/drizzle-orm/postgres-js).
 * When the insert fails, only that savepoint rolls back; the outer
 * transaction (still open) can then re-SELECT the winner's row and
 * proceed with the submission + audit as normal.

/**
 * Resolves a queue item (curator/admin only — PRD §6.1; the caller, e.g.
 * Task 34's curator route, is responsible for the per-ward `canEditWard`
 * scope check BEFORE calling this — this function only asserts the actor's
 * ROLE, not their ward scope, since it has no ward-scope context of its
 * own for a `ward_field`/`ward_issue` target).
 *
 * ACCEPT (candidate_field targets only, for now — ward_field/ward_issue
 * accept-publish paths land in Tasks 34/39): publishes the field via
 * {@link publishCandidateFieldTx} and marks the item `accepted` in the
 * SAME transaction, so a publish can never land without its flag item
 * being marked resolved (or vice versa).
 *
 * REJECT: marks the item `rejected` with `reason`; never publishes
 * anything.
 *
 * Either way, resolving the ITEM resolves every collapsed submission at
 * once (PRD §6.3) — the outcome/reason lives on `flag_items`, and every
 * `flag_submissions` row for this item points at it, so there is no
 * per-submission update to make.
 *
 * RE-RESOLVE GUARD: an item can only be resolved once. The transaction
 * opens by re-selecting the flag_item row `FOR UPDATE` — this locks the
 * row against any concurrent resolveFlag call on the same id for the
 * duration of the transaction, and lets us assert `status === 'pending'`
 * BEFORE doing any publish work. If the item is no longer pending (already
 * accepted or rejected — including by a call that's racing us and wins the
 * lock first), this throws `flag_already_resolved` and rolls back: no
 * publish, no audit write, no status flip. Without this, two concurrent
 * accepts on the same item could both publish (double-publish), or an
 * accept followed by a reject could flip an already-published item's
 * status to `rejected` while leaving the publish in place. The UPDATE
 * statements additionally carry `status = 'pending'` in their WHERE clause
 * as defense in depth (belt-and-suspenders alongside the row lock).
