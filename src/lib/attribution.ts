/**
 * `?src={partner-slug}` attribution (architecture.md §5, §13; PRD §5.12).
 *
 * The nginx micro-cache key ignores the query string entirely (architecture
 * §5), so the server can never branch on `?src` without breaking cache
 * safety — there is exactly one cached HTML variant per URL/language, and it
 * must be byte-identical whether or not a `?src` param is present. The whole
 * mechanism therefore lives client-side: `src/layouts/Base.astro` renders
 * `ATTRIBUTION_SCRIPT_SOURCE` as ONE of the two CSP-allowed nonce'd inline
 * scripts (the other is GA, Task 62) on every page. The script reads
 * `location.search` at runtime (the server HTML is identical with or
 * without `?src` — only the browser sees the query string) and, if a valid
 * slug is present, writes it to the `SRC_COOKIE_NAME` cookie. The
 * registration endpoint (`src/pages/api/otp/verify.ts`, via
 * `src/lib/auth-flow.ts#resolveOrRegister`) reads that same cookie name and
 * persists it onto the new user row as `srcAttribution` — attribution is
 * measurement-only (PRD §5.12): it grants no permission and changes nothing
 * the citizen sees.
 *
 * LAST-VALID-`src`-WINS: the script overwrites any existing `bv_src` cookie
 * whenever the current URL carries a valid slug, and leaves the cookie
 * untouched otherwise (no `?src`, or an invalid one). A citizen who arrives
 * via a second partner's link during the 30-day window is reattributed to
 * that newer partner rather than the first. This is the simpler of the two
 * defensible policies (first-touch is the other) and is an accepted,
 * intentional choice — not a bug.
 *
 * The slug pattern/length here MUST match `src/lib/partners.ts`'s
 * `SLUG_PATTERN`/`isValidPartnerSlug` — that module owns the authoritative
 * shape of a partner slug (used for the `/partner/{slug}` URL and CRUD
 * validation); this module keeps its own copy because the value also has to
 * be inlined, as a regex LITERAL, into a dependency-free browser script that
 * cannot `import` anything. Keeping both patterns textually identical (and
 * covered by tests on both sides) is the guard against drift.
